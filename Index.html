          <em>Guido van Rossum</em> created the Python programming language in the late <em>1980s</em>. In contrast to other popular
          languages such as <strong>C</strong>,     <strong> C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>C#</strong>, Python strives to provide a simple but powerful syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is used for software development at companies and organizations such as <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Yahoo</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>,
          <strong>CERN</strong>, <strong>Industrial Light and Magic</strong> , and <strong>NASA</strong>. Experienced programmers can accomplish great
          things with Python, but Python’s beauty is that it is accessible to beginning programmers and allows them
          to tackle interesting problems more quickly than many other, more complex languages that have a steeper
          learning curve.

          The text that makes up a Python program has a particular structure. The syntax must be correct, or the interpreter will generate error messages and not execute the program. This section introduces Python by providing a simple example program.
        </p>
        <p>
          A program consists of one or more statements. A statement is an instruction that the interpreter executes.
          The following statement invokes the print function to display a message:
        </p>
        <code>print(<span class="code-color">"This is a simple Python program"</span>)</code>
        <p>
          We can use the statement in a program. Listing 1.1 (simple.py) is one of the simplest Python programs that does something:
        </p>
        <p class="text-bg-color">
          Listing 1.1: simple.py
        </p>
        <code class="zero-margin">
          print(<span class="code-color">"This is a simple Python program"</span>)
        </code>
        <p>
          We will use Wingware’s WingIDE 101 to develop our Python programs. This integrated development
          environment is freely available from http://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101, and its target audience
          is beginning Python programmers. Its feature set and ease of use make WingIDE 101 an ideal
          platform for exploring programming in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way you launch WingIDE 101 depends on your operating system and how it was installed. Figure
          1.1 shows a screenshot of WingIDE 101 running on a Windows 8.1 computer. The IDE consists of a
          menu bar at the top, along with a tool bar directly underneath it, and several sub-panes within the window.
          The large, unlabeled pane in the upper left portion of the window is the editor pane in which we type in
          our program’s source code. The versions of WingIDE 101 for Apple Mac OS X and Linux are similar in
          appearance
        </p>
        <code>
          print(<span class="code-color">"This is a simple Python program"</span>)
        </code>
        <p>
          This is a Python statement. A statement is a command that the interpreter executes. This statement
          prints the message This is a simple Python program on the screen. A statement is the fundamental unit of
          execution in a Python program. Statements may be grouped into larger chunks called blocks, and blocks can
          make up more complex statements. Higher-order constructs such as functions and methods are composed
          of blocks. The statement
        
        <code>
          print(<span class="code-color">"This is a simple Python program"</span>)
        </code>
        
          makes use of a built in function named print. Python has a variety of different kinds of statements that we
          can use to build programs, and the chapters that follow explore these various kinds of statements.

          We created the program in Listing 1.1 (simple.py) and submitted it to the Python interpreter for execution.
          We can interact with the interpreter directly, typing in Python statements and expressions for its immediate
          execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter prompts the user for input with three greater-than symbols
          (>>>). This means the user typed in the text on the line prefixed with >>>. Any lines without the >>> prefix
          represent the interpreter’s output, or feedback, to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will find Python’s interactive interpreter invaluable for experimenting with various language constructs.
          We can discover many things about Python without ever writing a complete program.
        </p>
        <p>
          The WingIDE 101 interpreter pane displays black text on a white background. In
          order for readers of this text to better distinguish visually program source code from program output, we
          will render the user’s direct interaction with the Python interpreter as black text on a light-gray background.
          As an example, the following shows a possible interactive session with a user:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> print(<span class="code-color">"Hello!"</span>)
          Hello!
        </code>
        <p>
          The interpreter prompt (>>>) prefixes all user input in the interactive shell. Lines that do not begin with the >>> prompt represent the interpreter’s response.

          More interesting programs contain multiple statements. In Listing 1.2 (arrow.py), six print statements draw
          an arrow on the screen:
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text-bg-color">
          Listing 1.2: arrow.py

          print(<span class="code-color">"     *   "</span>)
          print(<span class="code-color">"  ***  "</span>)
          print(<span class="code-color">"  ***** "</span>)
          print(<span class="code-color">"   *   "</span>)
          print(<span class="code-color">"   *   "</span>)
          print(<span class="code-color">"   *   "</span>)
        </code>
        <p>
          We wish the output of Listing 1.2 (arrow.py) to be 
          <span  id="black-bg" class="black-bg">
            <span id="content-mg">
                *
               ***
              *****
                *
                *
            </span>
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you try to enter each line one at a time into the interactive shell, the program’s output will be intermingled
          with the statements you type. In this case the best approach is to type the program into an editor, save the
          code you type to a file, and then execute the program. Most of the time we use an editor to enter and run
          our Python programs. The interactive interpreter is most useful for experimenting with small snippets of
          Python code.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Listing 1.2 (arrow.py) each print statement “draws” a horizontal slice of the arrow. All the horizontal
          slices stacked on top of each other results in the picture of the arrow. The statements form a block of Python
          code. It is important that no whitespace (spaces or tabs) come before the beginning of each statement. In
          Python the indentation of statements is significant and the interpreter generates error messages for improper
          indentation. If we try to put a single space before a statement in the interactive shell, we get
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> print(<span class="code-color">'hi'</span>)
          File "stdin>", line 1
            print(<span class="code-color">'hi'</span>)
            ˆ
            IndentationError: unexpected indent
        </code>
        <p>
          The interpreter reports a similar error when we attempt to run a saved Python program if the code contains
          such extraneous indentation.

              <header>Integer and String Values</header>
        <p>
          The number four (4) is an example of a numeric value. In mathematics, 4 is an integer value. Integers
          are whole numbers, which means they have no fractional parts, and they can be positive, negative, or zero.
          Examples of integers include 4, −19, 0, and −1005. In contrast, 4.5 is not an integer, since it is not a whole
          number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python supports a number of numeric and nonnumeric values. In particular, Python programs can use
          integer values. The Python statement
        
        <code>
          print(<span class="code-color">4</span>)
        </code>
        
          prints the value 4. Notice that unlike Listing 1.1 (simple.py) and Listing 1.2 (arrow.py) no quotation marks
          (") appear in the statement. The value 4 is an example of an integer expression. Python supports other types
          of expressions besides integer expressions. An expression is a basic building block of a Python statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number 4 by itself is not a complete Python statement and, therefore, cannot be a program. The
          interpreter, however, can evaluate a Python expression. You may type the enter 4 directly into the interactive
          interpreter shell:
        </p>
        <code>
          Python 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 24 2015, 22:44:40)
          [MSC v.1600 64 bit (AM
          D64)] on win32
          Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
          >>> 4
          4
          >>>
        </code>
        <p>
          The interactive shell attempts to evaluate both expressions and statements. In this case, the expression 4
          evaluates to 4. The shell executes what is commonly called the read, eval, print loop. This means the
          interactive shell’s sole activity consists of
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>reading the text entered by the user,</li>
          <li>attempting to evaluate the user’s input in the context of what the user has entered up that point, and</li>
          <li>printing its evaluation of the user’s input.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If the user enters a 4, the shell interprets it as a 4. If the user enters x = 10, a statement has has no overall
          value itself, the shell prints nothing. If the user then enters x, the shell prints the evaluation of x, which is 10.
          If the user next enters y, the shell reports a error because y has not been defined in a previous interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python uses the + symbol with integers to perform normal arithmetic addition, so the interactive shell
          can serve as a handy adding machine:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> 3 + 4
          7
          >>> 1 + 2 + 4 + 10 + 3
          20
          >>> print(<span class="code-color">1 + 2 + 4 + 10 + 3</span>)
          20
        </code>
        <p>
          The last line evaluated shows how we can use the + symbol to add values within a print statement that
          could be part of a Python program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider what happens if we use quote marks around an integer:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> 19
          19
          >>> "19"
          '19'
          >>> '19'
          '19'
        </code>
        <p>
          Notice how the output of the interpreter is different. The expression "19" is an example of a string value.
          A string is a sequence of characters. Strings most often contain nonnumeric characters:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> "Fred"
          'Fred'
          >>> 'Fred'
          'Fred
        </code>
        <p>
          Python recognizes both single quotes (') and double quotes (") as valid ways to delimit a string value. The
          word delimit means to determine the boundaries or limits of something. The left ' symbol determines the beginning of a string, and the right ' symbol that follows specifies the end of the string. If a single quote
          marks the beginning of a string value, a single quote must delimit the end of the string. Similarly, the double
          quotes, if used instead, must appear in pairs. You may not mix the two kinds of quotation marks when used
          to delimit a particular string, as the following interactive sequence shows:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> 'ABC'
          'ABC'
          >>> "ABC"
          'ABC'
          >>> 'ABC"
          File "stdin>", line 1
            'ABC"
            ˆ
            SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
            >>> "ABC'
            File ""&lt;<stdin>&lt;", line 1
              "ABC'
              ˆ
              SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
        </code>
        <p>
          The interpreter’s output always uses single quotes, but it accepts either single or double quotes as valid
          input.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter’s output always uses single quotes, but it accepts either single or double quotes as valid

          >>> 'Fred'
          'Fred'
          >>> Fred
          Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/stdin>", line 1, in module>
              NameError: name 'Fred' is not defined
        </code>
        <p>
          Notice that with the missing quotation marks the interpreter does not accept the expression Fred.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that the expressions 4 and '4' are different. One is an integer expression and
          the other is a string expression. All expressions in Python have a type. The type of an expression indicates
          the kind of expression it is. An expression’s type is sometimes denoted as its class. At this point we have
          considered only integers and strings. The built in type function reveals the type of any Python expression:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> type(4)
          class 'int'>
            >>> type('4')
            class  'str'>
        </code>
        <p>
          Python associates the type name int with integer expressions and str with string expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The built-in int function creates an actual integer object from a string that looks like an integer, and the
          str function creates a string object from the digits that make up an integer:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> 4
          4
          >>> str(<span class="code-color">4</span>)
          '4'
          >>> '5'
          '5'
          >>> int(<span class="code-color">'5'</span>)
          5
        </code>
        <p>
          The expression str(4) evaluates to the string value '4', and int('5') evaluates to the integer value 5.
          The int function applied to an integer evaluates simply to the value of the integer itself, and similarly str
          applied to a string results in the same value as the original string:
        </p>
        <code>
          >>> int(<span class="code-color">4</span>)
          4
          >>> str(<span class="code-color">'Judy'</span>)
          Judy

          <header>Variables and Assignment</header>
          <p>
            In algebra, variables represent numbers. The same is true in Python, except Python variables also can
            represent values other than numbers. Listing 2.1 (variable.py) uses a variable to store an integer value and
            then prints the value of the variable.
          </p>
          <p class="text-bg-color">
            Listing 2.1: variable.py
          </p>
          <code class="zero-margin">
            x = 10
            print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)
          </code>
          <p>
            Listing 2.1 (variable.py) contains two statements:
          </p>
          <code>x = 10</code>
          <p>
            This is an assignment statement. An assignment statement associates a value with a variable. The
            key to an assignment statement is the symbol = which is known as the assignment operator. The
            statement assigns the integer value 10 to the variable x. Said another way, this statement binds the
            variable named x to the value 10. At this point the type of x is int because it is bound to an integer
            value.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may assign and reassign a variable as often as necessary. The type of a variable will change if it
            is reassigned an expression of a different type.
          </p>
          
          <code>print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)</code>
          <p>
            This statement prints the variable x’s current value. Note that the lack of quotation marks here is very
            important. If x has the value 10, the statement
          
          <code>print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)</code>
          
            prints 10, the value of the variable x, but the statement
          
          <code>print(<span class="code-color">'x'</span>)</code>
          
            prints x, the message containing the single letter x.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meaning of the assignment operator (=) is different from equality in mathematics. In mathematics,
            = asserts that the expression on its left is equal to the expression on its right. In Python, = makes the variable
            on its left take on the value of the expression on its right. It is best to read x = 5 as “x is assigned the value
            5,” or “x gets the value 5.” This distinction is important since in mathematics equality is symmetric: if
            x = 5, we know 5 = x. In Python this symmetry does not exist; the statement
          
          <code>5 = x</code>
          
            attempts to reassign the value of the literal integer value 5, but this cannot be done because 5 is always 5
            and cannot be changed. Such a statement will produce an error.
          </p>
          <code>
            >>> x = 5
            >>> x
            5
            >>> 5 = x
            File "stdin", line 1
              SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
          </code>
          <p>
            We can reassign different values to a variable as needed, as Listing 2.2 (multipleassignment.py) shows.
          </p>
          <p class="text-bg-color">
            Listing 2:2 multiple assignment.py
          </p>
          <code class="zero-margin">
          x = 10
          print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)
          x = 20
          print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)
          x = 30
          print(<span class="code-color">x</span>)
          </code>
          <p>
            Observe that each print statement in Listing 2.2 (multipleassignment.py) is identical, but when the program
            runs (as a program, not in the interactive shell) the print statements produce different results:
          </p>
          <p class="black-bg">
            10
            20
            30
          </p>

            While mathematicians are content with giving their variables one-letter names like x, programmers should
            use longer, more descriptive variable names. Names such as sum, height, and sub_total are much better
            than the equally permissible s, h, and st. A variable’s name should be related to its purpose within the
            program. Good variable names make programs more readable by humans. Since programs often contain
            many variables, well-chosen variable names can render an otherwise obscure collection of symbols more
            understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Python has strict rules for variable names. A variable name is one example of an identifier. An identifier
            is a word used to name things. One of the things an identifier can name is a variable. We will see in later
            chapters that identifiers name other things such as functions, classes, and methods. Identifiers have the
            following form:
          </p>
          <ul class="no-border-line">
            <li>An identifiers must contain at least one character.</li>
            <li>The first character of an identifiers must be an alphabetic letter (upper or lower case) or the underscore</li>
            <li>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_0123456789</li>
            
            <li>No other characters (including spaces) are permitted in identifiers.</li>
            <li>A reserved word cannot be used as an identifier</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Examples of valid Python identifiers include
          </p>
          <ul class="no-border-line">
            <li>x</li>
            <li>x2</li>
            <li>total</li>
            <li>port_22</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            None of the following words are valid identifiers:
          </p>
          <ul class="no-border-line">
            <li>sub-total (dash is not a legal symbol in an identifier)</li>
            <li>first entry (space is not a legal symbol in an identifier)</li>
            <li>4all (begins with a digit)</li>
            <li>*2 (the asterisk is not a legal symbol in an identifier)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Python is a case-sensitive language. This means that capitalization matters. if is a reserved word, but
            none of If, IF, or iF is a reserved word. Identifiers also are case sensitive; the variable called Name is
            different from the variable called name. Note that three of the reserved words (False, None, and True) are
            capitalized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programmers generally avoid distinguishing between two variables in the same context merely by differences
            in capitalization. Doing so is more likely to confuse human readers. For the same reason, it is
            considered poor practice to give a variable the same name as a reserved word with one or more of its letters
            capitalized.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing to remember about a variable’s name is that it should be well chosen. A
            variable’s name should reflect the variable’s purpose within the program. For example, consider a program
            controlling a point-of-sale terminal (also known as an electronic cash register). The variable keeping track
            of the total cost of goods purchased might be named total or total_cost. Variable names such as a67_99
            and fred would be poor choices for such an application.
